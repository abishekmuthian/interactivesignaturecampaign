**Petition: "Include GNE Myopathy in India's Rare Diseases Policy"**

---

**Background:**  
GNE Myopathy, also known as Hereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy (HIBM), Nonaka Myopathy or Distal Myopathy with Rimmed Vacuoles (DMRV), is a rare, progressive muscle-wasting disease. Given its rarity, there is no treatment for this disease. Patients affected by this disease face many challenges including delayed diagnosis and little understanding of disease management. The National Policy for Rare Diseases, 2021 was enacted by the Indian government to address challenges faced by people living with rare diseases. Yet many rare diseases including GNE myopathy are not recognised by the policy. Recognizing and including GNE Myopathy in the policy will allow people living with this disease to obtain essential government support for research and treatments.

**Petition Statement:**  
We, the undersigned, urge the Indian Government to recognize and include GNE Myopathy in the National Policy for Rare Diseases. By doing so, patients suffering from this rare condition will get a better opportunity for timely diagnosis, treatment, and research, enabling a better quality of life.

**Key Points for Advocacy:**

1. **Awareness and Early Diagnosis:** Inclusion in the policy will promote awareness among healthcare professionals, enabling early and accurate diagnosis.

2. **Support for Research:** Recognition under the policy will facilitate utilisation of government resources for research, opening avenues for potential therapies or cures for GNE myopathy.

3. **Affordable Treatment:** Inclusion in the policy will enable access to subsidized treatments or potential schemes supporting those affected by GNE myopathy.

4. **Patient Support:** Families and patients will benefit from targeted welfare programs, psycho-social support, and community outreach initiatives under the policy.

5. **Global Solidarity:** India's recognition would further global collaboration and solidarity in battling this condition.
